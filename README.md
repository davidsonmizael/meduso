# Meduso

## WARNING: This was a project created on 2018 that I found on a backup and that I decided to improve. Do not relay on it as it can be full of bugs and unsupported features.

Meduso is an open-source post-exploitation tool for students, researchers and developers. Which includes the following:

- Botnet client payload for Windows
